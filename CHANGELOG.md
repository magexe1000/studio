# Studio Changelog

Each release on the OTA channel is described in its own section below.
The release script (`scripts/release-firebase.mjs`) reads this file and
copies the bullet list under the section that matches the current
`APP_VERSION` into `version.json`'s `changelog` field, so the in-app
"Update available" modal always shows the actual changes that ship in
that bundle.

Conventions:
- One H2 heading per version: `## X.Y.Z` (no leading `v`).
- Bullets start with `- ` and use plain English a non-technical user
  can parse. Keep each line short — the modal's text area is narrow.
- List the user-visible changes only. Internal refactors, tooling,
  and CI tweaks do not need a bullet.
- Newest version goes on top.
